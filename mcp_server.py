def get_job_recommendation(what: str, salary_min: int) -> dict:
    """
    Searches live Indian job listings (Adzuna) by keyword and minimum salary.

    Input Parameters:
    what (str) - One or more SINGLE KEYWORDS, space-separated. This is NOT a job
        title phrase — each space-separated word is matched as a separate keyword,
        not as part of one title. Use 1-2 core keywords, not a full title.
        Good: "python", "datascientist", "python fastapi", "machinelearning".
        Avoid: "machine learning engineer" (three separate required keywords,
        which over-narrows results since a listing must contain all three).
        Never pass a parameter name (like "salary_min") or an instruction as this value.
    salary_min (int) - Minimum ANNUAL salary in Indian Rupees (INR), e.g. 400000 for ₹4 LPA.
        Not USD. Typical entry-level India tech salaries start around 300000-600000.

    Returns:
    JSON with a "results" list. Each job object includes: title, company.display_name,
    description, salary_min, salary_max (all INR), location.display_name, and
    redirect_url (the direct apply link for that job).

    Example: get_job_recommendation(what="python", salary_min=400000)
    Example: get_job_recommendation(what="datascientist", salary_min=500000)

def get_resume_data(query:str) -> dict:
    """
    Retrieves chunks of the candidate's resume via similarity search.

    Input Parameters:
    query (str) - A resume TOPIC to search for, e.g. "skills", "work experience",
        "education", "years of experience". This must be a topic that appears IN
        the resume itself — not an instruction, judgment, or classification task
        (e.g. do NOT query "seniority level classification"; instead query "work
        experience" and determine seniority yourself from what's returned).

    Returns:
    A list of matching resume text chunks. Content is chunked, so multiple calls
    with different topic queries are usually needed to get a full picture.

    Example: get_resume_data(query="skills")
